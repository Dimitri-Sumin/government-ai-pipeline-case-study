# Government AI Pipeline – Analytical Case Study

Analytical case study built on a real institutional AI commercial pipeline involving minister-level engagements.  
Focus on transforming qualitative strategic work into a structured dataset, with normalization, segmentation logic, and an AI readiness scoring prototype.

## What this is
- Real pipeline, real interactions, anonymized for confidentiality
- Goal: convert messy CRM-style notes into analyzable tables
- Output: structured dataset + SQL exploration + scoring logic (later)

## Current stage
- Dataset anonymization: in progress
- Normalization: in progress
- Initial SQL exploration: next
- Scoring prototype: planned

## Repository structure
- `/data` – anonymized samples / schema examples (no sensitive data)
- `/sql` – exploratory and modeling queries
- `project_status.md` – short progress notes

## Notes on confidentiality
No client names, personal data, or identifiable institutions are included.
